## React CDN Setup — Creating a React Element

This is my first React.js practice task.<br>
In this example, I created a simple React element and added it to the DOM using CDN links and a script tag.

### What I learned

How to include React and ReactDOM using CDN links<br>
How to use React.createElement()<br>
How to render a React element into the page using ReactDOM.createRoot()<br>
Basic setup without any build tools (no npm, no Vite)

### Files in this folder

index.html – Contains the CDN links and root container<br>
script.js – Contains the JavaScript code to create and render the React element
